			Oct 2024: Initial research and technical preparation.
				1. Research and Technology Selection:
					○ Research large models (e.g., GPT, BERT) APIs and test integration methods.
					○ Finalize the tech stack: Node.js, TypeScript, VSCode plugin framework, and choose the appropriate large model services (e.g., OpenAI API, Hugging Face).
				2. Initial Design and Development:
					○ Begin building the plugin framework, ensuring the plugin runs in VSCode and can interact with APIs.
					○ Implement the basic plugin UI and design a simple error message display.
					○ Write the initial error detection logic, using rules and static analysis techniques to identify basic syntax errors.
					
			
			Nov 2024: Core feature implementation and User testing
				• Core Functionality Development:
					• Implement initial error detection features and integrate them with a large model API to ensure smart suggestions are provided.
					• Start designing and developing the framework for interactive tutorials, completing at least one tutorial for common error fixes.
				• Large Model Integration:
					• Test different large models and choose the one best suited for error detection and explanation.
					• Implement natural language explanations in error messages, using the large model to provide human-like explanations.
				• Real-Time Feedback:
					• Implement real-time feedback that detects errors as users type, without waiting for code execution.
				Preliminary User Testing:
					• Invite some users (both beginners and experienced developers) to test an early version of the plugin and gather feedback.
					• Refine the error messages and user interface based on the feedback.
					
				
			Dec 2024:  Smart error suggestion and interactive tutorials
					• Develop advanced smart error suggestion features, using a large model to provide context-aware suggestions and fixes.
					• Complete more interactive tutorials to ensure users can receive instant guidance on fixing common errors.
					• Implement personalized error suggestions based on user experience levels.
					• Conduct further user testing and gather feedback.
				
				
			Jan 2025:   Features expantion and multi-language 
					• Expand the plugin’s capabilities by adding more error types and suggestions for code optimization.
					• Refine the plugin's user interface to ensure it is intuitive and user-friendly.
					• Continue user testing, focusing on the experience of users at different skill levels, and make personalized adjustments.
					• Implement multi-language support (if needed) to ensure the plugin is usable by developers worldwide.
				
				
			Feb 2025:    Feature refinement and optimization
					• Refine and optimize features based on user feedback, fixing bugs and improving existing functions.
					• Expand syntax checking and error suggestion rules to handle more complex code scenarios.
					• Conduct extensive performance testing to ensure the plugin's stability across different development environments.
					• Prepare for publishing on the VSCode Marketplace.
					
				
			Mar 2025:   Final testing and launch preparation
					• Integrate all features and ensure the plugin runs smoothly across platforms and environments.
					• Conduct final user testing, gathering feedback on the overall user experience and functionality.
					• Fix any remaining bugs and further optimize performance and interface.
					• Prepare the release materials, including user documentation, installation guides, and manuals.
				
				
			Apr 2025:   Report  and Screencast
					• Write a complete project report, detailing the project background, development process, technical implementation, testing results, and user feedback.
					• Prepare a screencast to show the plugin's features, innovations, and technical implementations.
